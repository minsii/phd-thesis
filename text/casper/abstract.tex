\begin{abstract}

In this paper we present ``Casper,'' a process-based asynchronous
progress solution for MPI one-sided communication on multi- and
many-core architectures.  Casper uses transparent MPI call redirection
through PMPI and MPI-3 shared-memory windows to map memory from
multiple user processes into the address space of one or more ghost
processes, thus allowing for asynchronous progress where needed while
allowing native hardware-based communication where available.  Unlike
traditional thread- and interrupt-based asynchronous progress models,
Casper provides the capability to dedicate an arbitrary number of
ghost processes for asynchronous progress, thus balancing application
requirements with the capabilities of the underlying MPI
implementation.  We present a detailed design of the proposed
architecture including several techniques for maintaining correctness
per the MPI-3 standard as well as performance optimizations where
possible.  We also compare Casper with traditional thread- and
interrupt-based asynchronous progress models and demonstrate its
performance improvements with a variety of microbenchmarks and a
production chemistry application.
