% Please verify I'm not lying. Note that the first platform lacks the

In our experiments we used two different platforms:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first platform is a single node equipped with
  six-core Intel Xeon X5680 CPUs, 20~GB of main
  memory, and two Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner cards (stepping B0,
  61 cores) featuring 8~GB of GDDR5 RAM (5.5 GT/s) connected to
  16-lane PCIe 2.0 ports under the same PCIe root.
\item The second platform is a cluster composed of 8 compute nodes
  featuring dual Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPUs, 64~GB of RAM, and a single Knights
  Corner card (stepping B1, 60 cores) with 8~GB of on-board RAM (5.0 GT/s)
  connected to a 16x PCIe 2.0 port. The nodes are connected through an
  InfiniBand QDR fabric.
\end{itemize}
All nodes run the Linux kernel version 2.6.32. 
%In addition, all MIC cards are pre-production revisions.
%note: B1 is production

The first platform lets us evaluate intranode MIC-to-MIC data
transfers, while the second platform provides a distributed
environment for evaluating internode transfers.
